        <p class="about__paragraph"> Hi there, I'm Nick, a passionate self-taught web developer who has always been
            interested in building and fixing
            things. After discovering my love for web development, I decided to transition into the sector and pursue my
            passion.</p>

        <p class="about__paragraph"> At 35 years old, I bring my wealth of problem-solving and critical thinking
            experience to every project I
            undertake.
            I have taught myself various programming languages, including HTML, CSS, Sass, Mongoose, Node.js, and
            Express,
            to
            create stunning and functional websites.</p>

        <p class="about__paragraph"> I am dedicated to delivering high-quality work to my clients, and I take pride in
            my attention to detail and
            willingness to learn new techniques. I am always looking for ways to expand my skill-set and stay up-to-date
            with the
            latest web development trends, making me a valuable asset to any team.</p>

        <p class="about__paragraph"> My ability to communicate complex ideas to non-technical team members and clients
            makes me an excellent
            collaborator. I am committed to delivering excellent work, and I have earned a reputation for being reliable
            and
            easy to work with.</p>

        <p class="about__paragraph">In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my family, working on DIY projects, and
            learning new skills. I am
            excited about the opportunities that the web development sector presents and am committed to making a
            positive
            impact in the industry.</p>
